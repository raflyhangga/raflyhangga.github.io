I am an undergraduate computer science student at the Bandung Institute of Technology with a strong focus on computer systems. My work centers on building and analyzing large-scale storage I/O tracing systems across Windows, Linux, and mobile platforms. I am interested in understanding real-world storage behavior, caching, SSD performance, and end-to-end data paths.

I also enjoy designing efficient software systems, from high-performance data pipelines to backend services. My long-term goal is to study and build systems that improve how modern machines manage data at scale.

**Research Experience**
----
* Built a cross-platform I/O tracing system ([Windows](https://github.com/cacheMon/io-tracer-win) ETW & [Linux](https://github.com/cacheMon/io-tracer) eBPF/BCC) to collect real-world storage, filesystem, and network events.
* Implement [Clock with Adaptive Replacement](https://theory.stanford.edu/~sbansal/pubs/fast04.pdf) on [libCacheSim](https://github.com/1a1a11a/libCacheSim).
